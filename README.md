# real-time-monophonic-pattern-detection


**Folder Structure**

 - data - Store the csv converted MIDI track and patterns
 - det - Scripts for the Deterministic System
 - midi - Store the MIDI files
 - snn - Scripts for the Single Neural Network System
 - mnn - Scripts for the Multiple Neural Network System


 **OPERATIONAL PROCEDURE**

  *Patterns are stored as MIDI files. In a real world scenairio, the track will re real time, but for simulations, the track is also saved as a MIDI file*

  1. *create_test_data.ipynb* is used to convert the MIDI track and the patters to CSV.
